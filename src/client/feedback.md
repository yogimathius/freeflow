I'm sure everyone has their own way of answering that one
Here is my version of it:
Basically you are trying to tell highlight your skills, based on the last project you worked/finished. You can start with by giving a quick description of what the project was about.
Example: "The last project I worked on was a " I decided to make a pictionary clone, the idea was that annon users can come in together and take turns at drawing and guessing.  etc..."
If this is a personal project you can get into talking about why you picked language X over language Y. (ie: benefits between NodeJS vs Ruby vs Php , etc )
Once they got the general gist of what the project was about you can start talking about some of the features you helped implement and were in charge off.  Here you can talk about:
approach of implementation
tech used
packages/api's used
performance benefits
that were used in the feature that you had to research and implement. In this stage, you want to be very descriptive in every aspect of those 4 points. The person that is interviewing you will prob ask questions about the direction you took when implementing, so be prepared to state on the why's .
Now, make sure the features you talk about cater towards the position you are applying for. If you are applying for front-end position, I'd talk about most of my features on the front-end rather than the back-end and vice versa.
They will most likely ask you something among the lines of: "What the most challenging part about the feature X that you have done? How would you do it differently given that you have more experience now? "
Definitely prep for those.
They may also poke holes in your features and propose a solution that maybe be better than the way you have implemented. For that prep up a good answer of why you did it a certain way than other, (for example if someone suggests you that there is an NPM package that does everything you need VS you making that same feature from scratch )  IF the solution proposed is actually a better than your solution, be receptive, acknowledge, and try not to be overly defensive ( this can play into that you are not good at taking feedback )
Those are the things that came to mind, curious if any other people have more tips
